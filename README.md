## The Problem:
**Train Travel can be overwhelming for the elderly.** <br>Keeping track of connecting train numbers, correct boarding platforms, transfer times, etc can lead to confusion, sometimes resulting in unfortunate situations.

**Technological Fears.** <br>General resistance towards using phone applications, sometimes even smartphones, reduces the possibilities of using new technological solutions to address this problem.

## Values 
Independence, Convenience, Personalized

## Mission?
Travel Angels is an SMS based, intelligent travel assistant, that provides personalized guidance to the elderly through every stage of their SBB journey, from home till destination.

## Strategy
###### Initial Vision
- SBB could provide a yearly chat-bot subscription for people who would like constant assistance during their train journeys. - Subscribed members would receive SMS guidance with regards to their train timings, platform numbers, connecting train details, refreshment and other station amenities, and also assistance in stressful situations like boarding wrong trains and reaching unintended locations.
- The idea was to develop a friendly and approachable AI driven assistant, that responds to natural language of the user, thereby making the user experience extremely intuitive and comfortable considering the target user group
