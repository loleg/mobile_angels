## Project Challenge:
Build on the existing services and data provided by SBB, to simplify the travel experience of the elderly.

SBB open data portal: http://data.sbb.ch/explore/?sort=modified
It provides access to SBB train timings, refreshments and other ammenities on train stations, and a lot more.

## The Problem:
- Train travel from one place to another can sometimes be overwhelming for the elderly.
- Keeping track of connecting train numbers, correct boarding platforms, transfer times, etc can lead to confusion, sometimes resulting in unfortunate situations.

## Framework Definition
Our focus:
How do you simplify SBB train schedule information such that, the elderly have a clear understanding and therefore, a frictionless journey from home to destination?
